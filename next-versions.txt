In the next version of the app, implement the following:

Display a list of all groups the user is a member of.

Allow the user to attempt joining any group from the list.

Before granting access to the group, prompt the user to enter the group’s secret code for verification.

Only if the entered code is correct, allow the user to access and chat in that group.

✅ Functional Requirements

Fetch and display user's group list after login/initial setup.

On "Join" action:

Prompt for group code.

Validate code on the backend.

If valid → join the group.

If invalid → show error message (e.g., “Incorrect group code”).

should be able to send images and videos in the group.
